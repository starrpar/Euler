Instructions for running this App / Java project:

1. Grab DAS.jar file and put it somewhere that jar and java commands will work.
2. Run the command "jar -xf DAS.jar"; this will place all of the appropriate files locally.
3. Run the command "java App" - this will execute an example demo of the app executing donation insertion into the DB from a JSON input file and allocating distributions (hardcoded in the app code to provide an example).
4. Consult file "application-2024xxxx.log" in execution directory to review logged output.
